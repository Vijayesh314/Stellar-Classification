# Stellar-Classification

The project focuses on building a machine learning classification model to predict the type of star, such as main sequence, dwarfs, or giants, based on their physical characteristics. Using a dataset of 240 stars with features like temperature, luminosity, radius, absolute magnitude, color, and spectral class, I trained a Random Forest model in R to classify stars into one of six types.

Key Steps
* Cleaned and renamed features
